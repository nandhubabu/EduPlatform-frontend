Student Profile:
- Education Level: ${userProfile.educationLevel} (${educationContext})
- Dominant Interest: ${dominantInterest}
- Knowledge Level: ${knowledgeLevel} (scored ${knowledgeScore}/5)

Progressive Context:
${progressiveContext}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIQUENESS:
1. This question MUST focus specifically on: ${currentFocus}
2. Question ${questionIndex + 1} should be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from previous questions
3. Build upon the specific patterns shown in their previous responses
4. Use their dominant interest (${dominantInterest}) as context but focus on the specific area above
5. Question should be detailed and scenario-based, not generic
6. AVOID these common question patterns: "What type of...", "Which of the following...", "How would you prefer..."
7. Create SPECIFIC situational questions with detailed contexts
8. Each question must explore a UNIQUE aspect not covered before

PREVIOUS QUESTIONS TO AVOID SIMILARITY:
${progressiveContext}

Question Uniqueness Seed: ${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}_${questionIndex}_${Date.now()}

Format your response as JSON:
{

    {"text": "Option C with alternative perspective", "category": "${dominantInterest}"},
    {"text": "Option D with contrasting viewpoint", "category": "alternative"}
  ]
}

 EXAMPLE FORMAT (DO NOT COPY):
If focusing on "work environment preferences" for technology interest:
"You're offered three ${dominantInterest} roles with different work settings. Which appeals most to you?"

Make this question highly specific to ${currentFocus} and completely unique from any previous questions.
